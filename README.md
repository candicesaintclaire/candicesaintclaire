# Hi, I'm Candice!

### 🤖 I'm a professional reseller & eBay store owner, a vibe-coder and LLM early-adopter, and a Web 1.0 veteran who has recently picked up learning to code (again) to solve legitimate challenges I face in my reselling business. 

I practice **"Learning in Public."** My goal is to build tools that solve actual logistical problems I face in my e-commerce business, using "heavy vibe coding" (AI-assisted workflows) to iterate fast.

### 🔭 Current Focus
* **🐍 Python:** Learning the fundamentals and scripting for automation with Zed Shaw's book & the OpenStax text, simultaneously.
* **🧩 Chrome Extensions:** Building tools to improve browser workflows (e.g., for eBay/reselling, storage auction buyers, etc).
* **⚡ Speed:** Leveraging quick typing (100+ WPM), the command line, keyboard shortcuts, and other speed hacks to navigate around the screen quickly.
