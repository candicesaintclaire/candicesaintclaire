# Hi! 👋

I'm a pro-reseller & eBay store owner / a Web 1.0 veteran who has recently picked up learning to code (again) to solve legitimate frictions and business challenges I face in my reselling business. I practice **"Learning in Public."** My goal is to ship high-utility, zero-fluff tools for myself and potentially for others, in the future. I'm a fast typist and that's a big help - I also love still practicing my typing on an almost-daily basis, even though it's been over 30 years since I learned how to touch type on a keyboard/QWERTY setup (I learned in the 4th grade!)

I'm currently foucsed on learning Python, working through Zed Shaw's book and the OpenStax Python text, simultaneous. Check out my LIP repo for more updates, etc. 

#### 🆕 I just built my first Python program! It's a token counter designed to tell you how many tokens are in a given set of files (ie: text files, markdown files, etc). Check out my repo, Token Counter, for more info!
